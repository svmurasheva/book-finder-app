              "description": "Google, the most popular search engine worldwide, provides web surfers with an easy-to-use guide to the Internet, with web and image searches, language translation, and a range of features that make web navigation simple enough for even the novice user. What many users don't realize is that the deceptively simple components that make Google so easy to use are the same features that generously unlock security flaws for the malicious hacker. Vulnerabilities in website security can be discovered through Google hacking, techniques applied to the search engine by computer criminals, identity thieves, and even terrorists to uncover secure information. This book beats Google hackers to the punch, equipping web administrators with penetration testing applications to ensure their site is invulnerable to a hacker's search. Penetration Testing with Google Hacks explores the explosive growth of a technique known as \"Google Hacking.\" When the modern security landscape includes such heady topics as \"blind SQL injection\" and \"integer overflows,\" it's refreshing to see such a deceptively simple tool bent to achieve such amazing results; this is hacking in the purest sense of the word. Readers will learn how to torque Google to detect SQL injection points and login portals, execute port scans and CGI scans, fingerprint web servers, locate incredible information caches such as firewall and IDS logs, password databases, SQL dumps and much more - all without sending a single packet to the target! Borrowing the techniques pioneered by malicious \"Google hackers,\" this talk aims to show security practitioners how to properly protect clients from this often overlooked and dangerous form of information leakage.*First book about Google targeting IT professionals and security leaks through web browsing. *Author Johnny Long, the authority on Google hacking, will be speaking about \"Google Hacking\" at the Black Hat 2004 Briefing. His presentation on penetrating security flaws with Google is expected to create a lot of buzz and exposure for the topic. *Johnny Long's Web site hosts the largest repository of Google security exposures and is the most popular destination for security professionals who want to learn about the dark side of Google.",

              "description": "This book offers a practical approach to conducting research in foreign languages on topics with a global nexus. It introduces the problem researchers face when getting started with a research problem, such as setting up the research environment and establishing goals for the research. The researcher then needs to prepares and to conduct foreign-language research by generating key terms and searching the right places where the information they seek is most likely to be stored. Using the appropriate advanced search operators, the researcher narrows down the search results to the desired sources, thereby eliminating the irrelevant sources. Specialized knowledge of country-specific domains advances the specificity and relevance of the researcher’s efforts. The methods and tools demonstrated in this book are applicable to a variety of academic and practical fields. A doctor may ask “what are other experts in my field saying about ABC disease?” A sommelier may ask “where else in the world are XYZ grape varietals grown?” A businessman may ask “who are my global competitors in my market?” A doctoral student may ask “have any other students at universities abroad ever written a dissertation about my topic, too?” With the tools and techniques demonstrated in this book, all of these questions are answerable. This book concludes with chapters on translation and citation methods, and includes three case studies that demonstrate the practical use of the methods discussed above. This book targets academic researchers as well as students and faculty. This book will also be a good fit as an assigned reading for a college course on thesis/dissertation research.",

The methods that you would adopt or Boolean strings that used to work today may not work tomorrow and there is a constant learning curve to keep oneself updated and also brings a healthy level of competition among individuals eager to show their wares. The volume based or niche skills hiring has become a race to the finish. The individuals with the super sourcing as well as relationship management skills tend to be more often than not the winners in the end. The recruitment community looks to find the needle in the haystack every day to find the right candidate to fulfill the hiring manager mandate. The ever bulging stock of search strings, productivity tricks and their ways of thinking they implement are a stuff of legend. The tools do not make a Sourcer or recruiter but they should always be seen as an assistant to free up their time for more productive conversations with prospective candidates. This exercise is an attempt to equip the Talent Acquisition community with the various ways and methods to optimize their time and find the relevant information (trends, movers and shakers etc.) to be better prepared to find relevant candidates for their clients (internal or external). It is by no means an exhaustive list but a start nonetheless.",

This book explores Open Source Intelligence Gathering (OSINT) inside out from multiple perspectives, including those of hackers and seasoned intelligence experts. OSINT refers to the techniques and tools required to harvest publicly available data concerning a person or an organization. With several years of experience of tracking hackers with OSINT, the author whips up a classical plot-line involving a hunt for a threat actor. While taking the audience through the thrilling investigative drama, the author immerses the audience with in-depth knowledge of state-of-the-art OSINT tools and techniques. Technical users will want a basic understanding of the Linux command line in order to follow the examples. But a person with no Linux or programming experience can still gain a lot from this book through the commentaries. This book’s unique digital investigation proposition is a combination of story-telling, tutorials, and case studies. The book explores digital investigation from multiple angles: Through the eyes of the author who has several years of experience in the subject. Through the mind of the hacker who collects massive amounts of data from multiple online sources to identify targets as well as ways to hit the targets. Through the eyes of industry leaders. This book is ideal for: Investigation professionals, forensic analysts, and CISO/CIO and other executives wanting to understand the mindset of a hacker and how seemingly harmless information can be used to target their organization. Security analysts, forensic investigators, and SOC teams looking for new approaches on digital investigations from the perspective of collecting and parsing publicly available information. CISOs and defense teams will find this book useful because it takes the perspective of infiltrating an organization from the mindset of a hacker. The commentary provided by outside experts will also provide them with ideas to further protect their organization’s data.",

The success of the DEXA series has partly been due to the way in which it has kept abreast of recent developments by spawning specialized workshops and conferences each with its own proceedings. In 2005 the DEXA programme was co-located with the 7th International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery [DaWaK 2005], the 6th International Conference on Electronic Commerce and Web Technologies [EC-Web 2005], the 4th International Conference on Electronic Government [EGOV 2005], the 2nd International Conference on Trust, Privacy, and Security in Digital Business [TrustBus 2005], the 2nd International Conference on Industrial Applications of Holonic and Multi-agent Systems [HoloMAS 2005], as well as 19 specialized workshops. These proceedings are the result of a considerable amount of hard work. Beginning with the preparation of submitted papers, the papers went through the reviewing process. This process was supported by online discussion between the reviewers to determine the final conference program. The authors of accepted papers revised their manuscripts to produce this fine collection. DEXA 2005 received 390 submissions, and from those the Program Committee selected the 92 papers in these proceedings. This year the reviewing process generated more than 1000 referee reports. The hard work of the authors, the referees and the Program Committee is gratefully acknowledged.",

Now you can use and improve on Google technology in your own applications. Mining Google Web Services teaches you dozens of techniques for tapping the power of the Google API. Google already gives you fine-grained control over your search criteria, and this book shows you how to exert the same control in your own focused search and analysis applications. With just a little knowledge of JavaScript, VBA, Visual Studio 6, Visual Studio .NET, PHP, or Java, you will get better (and more relevant) search results--faster and more easily. Here's a little of what you'll find covered inside: Improving the speed and accuracy of searches Performing data mining across the Internet Using Google Web Services to search a single website Building search applications for mobile devices Using caching techniques to improve application performance and reliability Analyzing Google data Creating searches for users with special needs Discovering new uses for Google Obtaining historical data using cached pages Performing spelling checks on any text Reducing the number of false search hits Whether your goal is to improve your own searches or share specialized search capabilities with others, this is the one resource that will see you through the job from start to finish.",
